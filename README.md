# SVG Logo Generator
## About
In this project, I created an SVG logo generator that is run from the command line. Users run "npm i" to install and "node index.js" to run the program. Users can input up to three letters, choose a color by color keyword or hexidecimal color code, choose from three shapes, and the shape color fill. A logo.SVG file is then loaded into the "dist" folder. I have created a test for each shape using jest. To run these test please input "npm run test" in your terminal. You can find example of logos generated using this app in the examples folder.
